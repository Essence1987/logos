# **Logo Generator** [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

I created this project to help others create a simple logo by answering a few quick questions. Utilize node in your terminal to answer a few questions regarding the logo, and a new SVG file will be created based on user input. The SVG file will contain your created logo, which you can utilize in any project you may need it.

# **Features**

This application utilizes inquirer to create a simple command prompt interface for creating a logo inside an SVG file.

# **Installation**

To run this application, clone a copy onto your pc by entering the following command in your terminal of choice:
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><br>git clone git@github<span>.com:Essence1987/logos.git</span></strong></p><br>
Once the repo is copied to your device, ensure your terminal is pointing at the cloned repos directory and enter the following command:
<p style="text-align: center;"><br><strong>node index.js</strong></p>

# **Usage**

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated SVG given the following input entered by the user: `SVG` for the text, `white` for the text color, `circle` from the list of shapes, and `black` for the shape color. Note that this is just an image of the output SVG and not the SVG file itself:

![Image showing a black circle with white text that reads "SVG.".](./examples/circle.svg)
